# Web development Project

Web development project created during a course by Rocketseat with HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQLite.

The project is called "Ecoleta" and it has a form with an API for states and city, which the user can enter a waste collection point and it's registered in a database showed on another page depending on what city the user search for.
